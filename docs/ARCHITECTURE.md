## Data & Scoring Guidelines

- All correctness, results, and scoring logic must be based on numeric IDs (e.g., team_id, round_id, user_id).
- Team names and other display strings must never be used for correctness comparisons or scoring decisions.
- Display strings are for UI only. Back end should compute correctness using IDs and emit places/IDs; the front end renders names purely for display.

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

This project was built with the support of modern **AI coding tools** to accelerate prototyping and implementation.  
- AI was used to generate scaffolding, boilerplate, and draft functions.  
- All code has been **curated, reviewed, and tested** by a human before release.  
- The use of AI allowed for faster iteration and a focus on architecture, usability, and overall project quality.
